sbt-proguard
============

[sbt] plugin for running [ProGuard]. This plugin requires sbt 1.4.x or later.


Add plugin
----------

Add plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`. For example:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.xuwei-k" % "sbt-proguard" % "{version}")
```

See [released versions][releases].

Note: earlier versions of sbt-proguard used the `"com.lightbend.sbt"` organization.

Example
-------

A simple `build.sbt` with settings to configure sbt-proguard:

```scala
enablePlugins(SbtProguard)

ProGuard / proguardOptions ++= Seq("-dontnote", "-dontwarn", "-ignorewarnings")

ProGuard / proguardOptions += ProguardOptions.keepMain("some.MainClass")
```

Run proguard at the sbt shell with:

```shell
proguard:proguard
```


Filters
-------

Proguard supports file filtering for inputs, libraries, and outputs. In
sbt-proguard there are `File => Option[String]` settings for adding filters to
files.

For example, to add a `!META-INF/**` filter to just the scala-library jar:

```scala
Proguard / proguardInputFilter := { file =>
  file.name match {
    case "scala-library.jar" => Some("!META-INF/**")
    case _                   => None
  }
}
```

which will create the following proguard configuration:

```
-injars "/path/to/scala-library.jar"(!META-INF/**)
```

There are corresponding settings for libraries and outputs: `proguardLibraryFilter` and
`proguardOutputFilter`.

For more advanced usage the `proguardFilteredInputs`, `proguardFilteredLibraries`, and
`proguardFilteredOutputs` settings can be set directly.


Merging
-------

If the same path exists in multiple inputs then proguard will throw an error.
The conflicting paths can be resolved using file filters, as described above,
but this is not always the most useful approach. For example, `reference.conf`
files for the Typesafe Config library need to be retained and not discarded.

The sbt-proguard plugin supports pre-merging inputs, similar to creating an
assembly jar first. To enable this merging use:

```scala
Proguard / proguardMerge := true
```

Conflicting paths that are not identical will now fail at the merge stage. These
conflicting paths can have merge strategies applied, similar to the [sbt-assembly]
plugin.

Helper methods for creating common merges are available. These are:

  - `discard` -- discard all matching entries
  - `first` -- only keep the first entry
  - `last` -- only keep the last entry
  - `rename` -- rename entries adding the name of the source
  - `append` -- append entries together into one file

The paths matched against in these helpers are normalised to be separated by `/`
regardless of platform. Paths can be matched exactly with a string or with a
regular expression.

The default strategy is to only discard `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`. This same
strategy could be added with:

```scala
Proguard / proguardMergeStrategies += ProguardMerge.discard("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF")
```

Or all `META-INF` contents could be discarded with a regular expression:

```scala
Proguard / proguardMergeStrategies += ProguardMerge.discard("META-INF/.*".r)
```

To concatenate all `reference.conf` files together use:

```scala
Proguard / proguardMergeStrategies += ProguardMerge.append("reference.conf")
```

To discard all `.html` and `.txt` files you may use two strategies together:

```scala
Proguard / proguardMergeStrategies ++= Seq(
  ProguardMerge.discard("\\.html$".r),
  ProguardMerge.discard("\\.txt$".r) 
)
```

Completely custom merge strategies can also be created. See the plugin source
code for how this could be done.
